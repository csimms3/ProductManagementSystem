# Store Inventory Manager

## What will it do?
The Store Inventory Manager will allow a store owner to manage their product inventory by:
- Creating **digital versions of their products**, with pricing, descriptions and images
- Keeping track of their **stock numbers**
- Processing **sales and shipments**
- Allowing them to **search** through their products digitally

## Who will use it?
The Store Inventory Manager will be used by any store employees 
to perform job duties, as well as by customers, who may search the
store's inventory and view products online. When used by customers,
certain actions may be restricted to prevent unauthorized price
alterations and similar activity.

## Why this project?
During high school, I had a part-time retail job which used an
inventory manager to do the things listed above, as
almost all stores do. As I became more interested in
programming and software development, I began to think
about how such a system could be designed and implemented.
This project will allow me to further pursue my curiosity
around this topic, allowing me to dive deeper into the specifics.
